# So from this we can conclusively say, wet weather significantly reduces total match scores with a p-value of 0.01.
# In dry conditions, the average total score is 169.36 points
# In wet conditions, the average total score is 158.68 points
# This represents approximately a 10.68-point decrease in wet weather
# The 95% confidence interval (2.52 to 18.84) confirms this decrease is statistically meaningful.
# 
# Goals are significantly reduced in wet weather:
# In dry conditions, teams score an average of 24.52 goals per match
# In wet conditions, this drops to 22.79 goals per match
# This represents approximately a 1.73-goal decrease
# 
# Behinds are NOT significantly affected:
# Dry conditions: 22.21 behinds per match
# Wet conditions: 21.94 behinds per match
# The difference of 0.27 behinds is not statistically significant therefore wet weather should not affect
# player goal kicking accuracy later on unless there is more kicks on the full or not making the distance
# This makes intuitive sense - wet conditions likely make it harder to execute clean ball handling needed for goals,
# while the overall difficulty of the game increases. The relatively stable number of behinds suggests players are 
# still getting shots on goal, but are less able to convert them into full 6-point scores in wet conditions.

# The Chi-Square Test was used to determine whether there is a significant relationship between 
# weather conditions and upsets.
# The chi-square test is ideal for categorical data and helps assess whether two categorical variables 
# are independent of each other.
# In this case, we are checking if upsets happen more or less frequently in wet weather
# The test compares the actual number of upsets in wet and dry conditions with the expected number 
# under the assumption that weather does not impact upsets.
# A significant result suggests that upsets are not randomly distributed across different weather conditions.
# 
# The p-value from the chi-square test was 0.0025, which is significant.
# This indicates that the probability of observing such a difference means
# weather likely has an influence on upsets.
# 
# Lets look at the GLM
# Intercept -0.8905, p = 0.0003
# The negative intercept suggests that, in the baseline scenario the probability of an upset occurring is relatively low.
# 
# Weather Condition is_wet: -1.2956, p = 0.0477
# Upsets are significantly less likely in wet weather.
# This aligns with the Chi-Square test results
# 
# Strength Difference strength_diff: -0.5977, p = 0.0145
# Greater differences in team strength reduce the likelihood of an upset.
# his is expected if a strong team faces a weak opponent, the stronger team is more likely to win, 
# 
# Betting Odds vs. Ladder Position used_odds: 1.7415, p = 0.0032 
# Using betting odds instead of ladder position increases the likelihood of identifying upsets. 
# 
# Interaction Between Weather & Strength Difference is_wet:strength_diff: -0.2075, p = 0.6893
# The interaction effect between weather and strength difference is not statistically significant.
# In other words, while wet weather makes upsets less likely overall, 
# its effect does not significantly depend on how evenly matched the teams are.
